This is a collection of my previous projects in Dragon Ruby that aren't already repos.<br>
To run these, put the inlcude directory, dragonruby.exe, and font.ttf files in the toplevel directory.<br>
From there you can use any of the run.bat files to run the programs.<br>
The pre.bat files compile the C scripts, but will need you to change the path.<br>
Also, most of these use DRPro features.<br>
